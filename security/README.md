# Security

When we are creating applications one important question that arises is How are we going to protect our application?,
How are we going to ensure that only the allow users can access to the apps?

In this section we are going to talk about Authorization, Authentication and some tools as JWT or Oauth2.0 that let us secure our
application in a proper way.

## Authentication

When we are talking about authentication basically we are answering the question, Who are you? In every single application
the users need an identity in order to do specific tasks, for this reason the authentication is a key concept in terms of security.

## Authorization

After authentication there is the authorization and this one is about, What can I do in the application?, As many of you may know
in several application there are different roles like admin, user so forth, and these roles are allowed to execute very specific tasks.

So authorization point to What action or which resource I am allowed to execute/use

## JWT

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely 
transmitting information between parties as a JSON object

The JWT Structure is composed by :

* Header
* Payload
* Signature

## Oaurh 2.0



  


## Spring Cloud Security

Spring Cloud Security offers a set of primitives for building secure applications and services with minimum fuss.
